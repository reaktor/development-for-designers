This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## How we got here

This directory was created by `yarn create next-app`, then cleaned up and simplified.

## Pre-requisites

You'll need Node and Yarn.

- Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Then install yarn on the command line `npm install -g yarn`. If you get an error, you may try `sudo npm install -g yarn`

## Getting Started

Open Terminal, navigate to the app directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd app
yarn
```

Now, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

You can press Ctrl-C to exit the server.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
